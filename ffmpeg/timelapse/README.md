# Timelapse cretor

This script:
* downloads images from a FTP server
* creates a timelapse from these images
* sends the timelapse with a Telegram bot
* renames the folder so it is not created twice

You will need to create a `config.sh` file with the overrides with the same format as `config.sample.sh`.
